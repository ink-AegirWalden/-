# Brief introduction
**This is a group work repository.**😊  
*This project is to predict diabetes related data through different algorithms, and evaluate, optimize and compare different algorithms.   
Contains linear regression, KNN, random forest.*

# 选择模型原因
## KNN
KNN is a nonparametric algorithm that does not require assumptions about the distrution.  
In addition,KNN is very sensitive to the similarity between feature classes and can adapt to diversed ata features.
## Linear regression
Linear regression model is simple and intuitive.
## Random forest
It can produce high-accuracy classifiers, which can deal with high-dim.  
High recall can be obtained, but the model needs to be adjusted.
